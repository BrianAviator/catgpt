Second Life LSL Code for a ChatGPT Chat Bot

**Instructions for Configuring the Chat Bot**
---
1. Create an object in second life or use a prefab object. (I used a mesh of a black cat for the "CatGPT" demo at the Museum of computing history).
2. Create a notecard and copy the contents of the config file in this reporsitory to it.
3. Adjust the parameters of the config file as follows:
    - API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
        - Change <YOUR_API_KEY> to your Open AI Platform API Key
        - You can get one at: [Open AI Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
        - Note: Usage of an API key is not free! By default we use gpt-4o-mini which is very inexpensive but it is not free. Pricing is available at: [Open AI API Pricing](https://openai.com/api/pricing/)
    - MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
        - This model works well for most purposes and is inexpensive but other models can be used.
    - TRIGGER_PREFIX=cat
        - This is the prefix to be added in chat to use the bot. The default is "cat" meaning an avatar in range of the bot can type "cat what is Second Life?" to have the bot respond about Second Life.
    - RATE_LIMIT=10.0
        - The number of seconds the user must wait between chat requests. This is to minimize abuse and manage API costs.
    - MAX_TOKENS=100
        - Sets a maximum on the data that the OpenAI API can use in a response. This is to manage API costs.
    - TEMPERATURE=0.7
        - Controls the randomness of the AI model output responses. 0.7 is a good number for a general chat bot.
    - DEBUG_MODE=0
        - Set to 1 if you want the script to output debugging information. Typically this should remain at 0.
    - SYSTEM_PROMPT=You are CatGPT, an AI demonstration exhibit in Second Life. Your responses should be brief (75-100 words at most) as they'll appear in public chat. Be helpful, and friendly. Your responses will be visible to everyone in the area, so keep them appropriate for all audiences, G-rated only.
        - Instructions to be given to the AI API. This governs how the bot behaves.
4. Create a new script in the inventory of the object and copy the contents of the catgpt.lsl file in this repository to the script contents.

**Instructions for Using the Chat Bot**
---
1. Stand within local chat distance of the chat bot object.
2. Type the Trigger Prefix ("*Cat*" in the above example) followed by your request:
    - *cat What is Second life?*
3. The bot will respond with the AI model output, example:
    - **You:** *cat What is Second Life?*
    - **Bot Response:** *CatGPT: Second Life is an online virtual world launched in 2003 where users, called avatars, can explore, create, and socialize. You can build your own spaces, interact with others, attend events, and even create and sell virtual goods. It's a platform for creativity and community, allowing people from around the world to connect and experience a variety of activities in a 3D environment. Enjoy your adventures!*
